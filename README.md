# Myrtle
A Harry Potter themed Wordle game

## How To Play
You have six attempts to guess the correct word. The answer can be any five letter word related to the Harry Potter universe, including spells and character names. Each guess must be a valid five letter word found in the English dictionary or Harry Potter books.

After submitting your guess, the color of the box will change to show how close your guess was to the answer:
* Gryffindor Red: the letter is not in the answer.
* Huffelpuff Yellow: the letter is in the answer, but in a different position.
* Slytherin Green: the letter is in the answer and the correct position.

Good luck and have fun!
